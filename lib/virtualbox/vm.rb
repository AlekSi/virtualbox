module VirtualBox
  # Represents a single VirtualBox virtual machine. All attributes which are
  # not read-only can be modified and saved.
  #
  # # Finding Virtual Machines
  #
  # Two methods are used to find virtual machines: {VM.all} and {VM.find}. Each
  # return a {VM} object. An example is shown below:
  #
  #     vm = VirtualBox::VM.find("MyWindowsXP")
  #     puts vm.name # => "MyWindowsXP"
  #
  # # Modifying Virtual Machines
  #
  # Virtual machines can be modified a lot like [ActiveRecord](http://ar.rubyonrails.org/)
  # objects. This is best shown through example:
  #
  #     vm = VirtualBox::VM.find("MyWindowsXP")
  #     vm.memory = 256
  #     vm.name = "WindowsXP"
  #     vm.save
  #
  # # Attributes and Relationships
  #
  # Properties of the virtual machine are exposed using standard ruby instance
  # methods which are generated on the fly. Because of this, they are not listed
  # below as available instance methods.
  #
  # These attributes can be accessed and modified via standard ruby-style
  # `instance.attribute` and `instance.attribute=` methods. The attributes are
  # listed below.
  #
  # Relationships are also accessed like attributes but can't be set. Instead,
  # they are typically references to other objects such as a {HardDrive} which
  # in turn have their own attributes which can be modified.
  #
  # ## Attributes
  #
  # This is copied directly from the class header, but lists all available
  # attributes. If you don't understand what this means, read {Attributable}.
  #
  #     attribute :uuid, :readonly => true
  #     attribute :name
  #     attribute :ostype
  #     attribute :description, :readonly => true

  #
  # ## Relationships
  #
  # In addition to the basic attributes, a virtual machine is related
  # to other things. The relationships are listed below. If you don't
  # understand this, read {Relatable}.
  #
  #     relationship :nics, Nic

  #     relationship :shared_folders, SharedFolder
  #     relationship :extra_data, ExtraData
  #     relationship :forwarded_ports, ForwardedPort
